      <![CDATA[Have you ever wanted to get a rock-hard upper body? Me too! I mean who likes soft, flabby arms and chest muscles? Nobody I know. That's why I've put together these 7 tips on building a rock-hard upper body. You'll be impressing the ladies (or the men) in no time.<p><a class="read-more" href="https://flybirdfitness.com/blogs/exercise-tips/7-tips-to-a-rock-hard-upper-body">More</a></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Your upper body and chest in particular are one of the most important parts of your physique. No matter how well your legs and back look, you still won't feel complete unless your upper body is in shape. So go ahead, take a look at these tips. As always, if you have any questions about strength training or about how to obtain great abs, just drop us a line. We're always happy to help.<br><br>An effective upper body workout program is one of the best things you can do to add definition to your body, boost your metabolism, and build a stronger physique. It's important to do upper body training in conjunction with lower body training and core training.<br><br>Maintaining a rock-hard upper body requires consistency, dedication, and hard work. You need to lift heavy and first use a <a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/blogs/guide/4-simple-steps-to-create-a-beginners-workout-plan" title="4 Simple Steps to Create a Beginner's Workout Plan">workout plan</a> that works for your needs.</p>
<h2>Warm up your delts with a set of light side raises.</h2>
<p><br>Warm up your delts with a set of light side raises. You can use dumbbells or cables for this exercise. You don't need to go really heavy, just work on getting the blood flowing. Do a few sets of 10 reps per arm. <br><br>To hit the middle and rear delts, use an overhead press with either dumbbells or barbells. This will also work your triceps and traps.<br><br>If you don't have any weights, you can try Flybird adjustable dumbbells, you can choose the best weights for you from <a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/products/flybird-adjustable-dumbbell-25lbs" title="Flybird 25lb adjustable dumbbells">25lb</a> and <a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/products/flybird-55lbs-adjustable-dumbbell" title="Flybird 55lb adjustable dumbbells">55lb</a>.</p>
<h2>Get Bigger With Your Chest Workouts</h2>
<p><br>The best way to get bigger is to be consistent with your workout routine, but there's more than one way to skin the proverbial cat. For example, if you tend to be hard on yourself and like to train at a high volume, going easy on yourself every once in a while can boost your strength gains.<br><br>If you have a hard time walking away from heavy chest training, try this method: Break down each muscle group into two sessions per week. You can still get plenty of work in on chest day with two full workouts, so consider lightening the mood by dropping the weight by 20 percent during one of those sessions. This will allow for more reps and sets overall, which will keep your muscles under tension for longer periods of time. This is important because it stimulates muscle growth.</p>
<h2> Don't underestimate the basic dumbbell curl.</h2>
<p>The dumbbell curl is one of the best exercises you can do to really isolate and stimulate those biceps. It's important to keep your elbows close to your sides in order for it to be effective, and don't swing them up or back as you raise the dumbbells — not only do you risk injuring yourself, but you also lessen the effort being placed on your biceps.<br><br>Use a variety of rep ranges. Lots of people think that doing high sets of 15-20 reps is the only way to build muscle in their arms, but this isn't true. You can build just as much muscle by doing 3 sets of 10-12 reps with heavy weights as you can with 20 reps and very light weights. Focus on quality over quantity when it comes to reps.</p>
<h2>Take it to the bench with incline flyes and press work.</h2>
<p>Doing chest exercises in an inclined position works your pecs from a slightly different angle and also helps to build your upper-chest muscles, which sit higher on your torso and are often neglected by standard flat-bench exercises.<br><br>Incline flyes can either be performed on a <a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/products/flybird-foldable-flat-weight-bench" title="Flybrid flat weight bench">flat weight bench</a> or a specialized incline bench that's designed for flies. The latter is preferable, as it will give you more range of motion and better support. Sit at the end of the <a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/collections/weight-benches" title="Flybird weight benches">weight bench</a> with your back flat against the pad and both feet firmly on the ground. Grab a pair of dumbbells, holding them directly above your shoulders so that your arms are extended straight up into the air.<br><br>Open up your chest and lower the weights out to each side until they're at shoulder level, being careful not to let them go any lower. Hold for a moment at the bottom of this position, then return to the starting position by bringing them back together into alignment over your chest once again.<br><br>If you're looking to build big muscles, do these first in your workout when you have more energy.</p>
<h2>Don't forget to hit the backside of your arms.</h2>
<p> The biceps are the most beloved show muscles of both men and women. But if you're going for size, they aren't actually all that important. Your lats and triceps play a much bigger role in making your upper body look big, so don't forget to train them.<br><br>The lats are the biggest muscles of the upper body and contribute significantly to the V-taper — that broad-shouldered, tapered look that's so coveted by lifters. They also extend from the lower back all the way up to the arms at the back of your shoulders. So when your lats get bigger, they can make your waistline appear smaller.<br><br>The triceps account for two thirds of your arm size — more than your biceps muscle — but they're often neglected in favor of training biceps because they're out of sight and thus out of mind. If you want those "horseshoe" triceps, you have to work them just as hard as you do your biceps.</p>
<h2>Get Plenty Of Sleep &amp; Manage Stress</h2>
<p>If you're constantly feeling stressed out about work or life in general, it can affect more than just your mental health; it can actually have a negative impact on your physique as well. Just like lack of sleep, high-stress levels can lead to lower testosterone levels, which can slow down muscle growth.<br><br>Sleep is more important than you think for building muscle and burning fat — if you're not getting at least 7-8 hours per night, it's time to start prioritizing your rest. Not only is sleep a great way to let your muscles recover from workouts, but it also helps regulate hormones and boost testosterone levels, both of which help increase muscle growth.</p>
<h2>
<br>Work in a little cardio, even if you're in PUMP mode.</h2>
<p><br>If you're trying to build muscle, doing cardio right after lifting may be counterproductive. However, warming up with 5-10 minutes of light cardio before lifting is a good way to get the blood pumping and improve your range of motion. To make sure you don't fatigue yourself too much, do a couple of light sets of any exercise before going all out on your heaviest set. This will help prevent injuries and also teach you how to pace yourself for the remainder of your workout.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Are you ready to put these tips into action? If so, I hope they help you get a rock-hard upper body. If there's any advice that you can absorb and use to your advantage, I'm sure of it. Keep these tips in mind when you hit the weights, and remember that there are always new ways to make any workout better. When all is said and done, your hard work will pay off if you're willing to make what might be small changes for big gains.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[After a tough workout, you're often left with a sore feeling in your muscles. Here are several tips for relieving the pain and discomfort of muscle soreness.<p><a class="read-more" href="https://flybirdfitness.com/blogs/exercise-tips/flybird-post-workout-tips">More</a></p>]]>
    </summary>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p>You looked fit and enjoyed going to the gym. That was important for you. The routine you followed, the foods you ate, and of course the regular exercise keeps your body in shape. You knew that <a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/collections/weight-benches" title="Flybird adjustable weight bench">Flybird weight bench</a> had given you a good workout. But some days later when your muscles started aching, you realized you should have taken a few things into consideration before doing a heavy workout session.<br><br>A good post-workout routine is key to getting results. There are a lot of little things that can help you get to your goals faster and maybe even prevent injury. Whether you're an athlete who is recovering from an injury, or just making a healthier lifestyle change, here are some post-workout tips to make sure you are getting the most out of your workouts.<br><br>Most weightlifting beginners at the beginning try only to break their muscles and ignore the rules of recovery after workouts. But in order to avoid losing muscle mass, we must follow the rules of post-workout recovery. Here we will give a few tips on how to quickly recover the body after heavy lifting so that instead of gaining our muscles, we do not lose them!</p>
<h2>Do not eat immediately.</h2>
<p>Post-workout nutrition is essential for muscle growth and recovery. The right post-workout foods and supplements will help you get the most out of your workouts and maximize your results.<br><br>Here are some tips to help you pick the best post-workout foods:<br><br>Do not eat immediately. Wait for at least an hour before getting down with your <a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/blogs/guide/how-meal-planning-can-save-money" title="How Meal Planning Can Save Money">meal</a>.<br><br>Eat a balanced meal with complex carbs and protein. Carbs will help restore your glycogen levels, while protein is essential for muscle development and recovery.<br><br>Limit red meat consumption as it takes a long time to digest. Stick to lean meats such as chicken, fish, turkey, or seafood.<br><br>High fiber food is also great for your post-workout meal as it is slow digesting and satiating too.</p>
<h2>Stay hydrated.</h2>
<p> Congratulations on finishing your Flybird workout! Now that you're done, it's time to refuel and recover.<br><br>Make sure you rehydrate. Drink plenty of fluids after exercise to make up for any lost water through sweating. Drink about 500ml of water within 30 minutes of finishing your workout. This can help your muscles recover more quickly and reduce soreness in the next few days. Try to refuel within 30 minutes. If you have worked out hard, then your body will be craving carbohydrates to replace the energy it has used up.<br><br>You should aim to replenish this energy with a snack or meal within 30 minutes of finishing your workout. This is especially important if you're planning to work out again soon, or if you're not going to be eating a meal for several hours. A snack containing both protein and carbohydrates is best for muscle recovery. A simple snack might be fruit and yogurt or a slice of wholemeal toast topped with peanut butter and banana slices.<br><br>It doesn't matter whether you just did a 10-minute <a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/blogs/workouts/everyone-s-favorite-ab-workout-you-can-do-it-at-home" title="Everyone’s Favorite Ab Workout – You can do it at home!">abs routine</a> or a 60-minute cardio session — you need to stay hydrated. Sweating is the body's natural cooling system, but it also means you lose fluids rapidly when exercising. Staying hydrated keeps the muscles and joints lubricated and helps prevent injuries.<br><br></p>
<h2>Stretch it out.</h2>
<p>After you complete your workout, it's important to stretch out the muscles that you just worked! Stretching helps to prevent injury and allows your body to recover quicker. <br><br>After a cardio workout, take a few minutes to stretch out your hamstrings, calves, and quads. If you don't know how to properly stretch these muscles, ask one of our trainers! They'll be more than happy to help you out.<br><br>After a weight lifting session, stretching is even more important. You need to stretch all the muscle groups that you worked on, not just the big ones. Ask your trainer for help if you're not sure how to do that.<br><br>Here are some post-workout stretches you can do:<br><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Calf Stretch</li>
<li>Quadriceps Stretch</li>
<li>Triceps Stretch</li>
<li>Hamstring Stretch</li>
<li>Groin Stretch</li>
</ul>
<h2>Get some rest.</h2>
<p>A good night's sleep is vital for recovery and repair of the body, especially for athletes who exercise intensely or frequently. Athletes need more sleep than regular people because of the amount of physical stress that may be involved in their training sessions. When you don't get enough sleep, you will find yourself feeling tired and fatigued when engaging in physical activities like sports or exercise. So, it is important to make sure you get enough sleep after training.</p>
<h2>Don’t Skip the Shower.</h2>
<p>You might be in a hurry to get home, but it’s important to shower off sweat as soon as possible after exercise. If you don’t, bacteria can accumulate on your skin, which can lead to body acne breakouts.<br><br><br>The sooner you shower after working out, the better. Sweat and bacteria can build up in your pores, which could lead to skin irritation and acne breakouts. If it’s not possible to shower immediately after exercising, at least wipe down with a towel or body wipe, suggests Dr. Jessica Krant, board-certified dermatologist and founder of Art of Dermatology in New York City and assistant clinical professor at SUNY Downstate Medical Center.<br><br>It’s also important to change out of sweaty clothes right away as this is another way for bacteria to breed.</p>
<p>In the end, you want to make sure that your weight bench is sturdy enough for you to work out safely. If you do this, and your fitness goals are short-term rather than long-term, then it's best to buy a Flybird weight bench for those kinds of workouts. </p>]]>

No problem — there are plenty of ways that you can become more physically fit without ever pulling on your gym shoes and heading out the door.<p><a class="read-more" href="https://flybirdfitness.com/blogs/exercise-tips/4-ways-you-can-make-yourself-fitter-without-going-to-the-gym">More</a></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>I don’t know about you but I tend to put off going to the gym, often for very good reasons — better things to be doing with my time, being tired and not in the mood, etc. I also don’t like having to clean up after myself once I am done working out, which is why I’m a big fan of at-home workout equipment. There are many options out there, but I recommend Flybird Exercise Equipment due to its quality and range of products.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Invest in Flybird Adjustable Weight Bench and Dumbbells.</h2>
<p>It's no secret that working out at home is much more convenient than going to the gym. If you want to work out at home, you will need your own equipment. One of the best purchases you can make for your home gym is an adjustable weight bench and dumbbells.<br><br>This is the most important exercise equipment you can get if you want to save money and time. With this, you can do a variety of exercises without having to go to the gym. We recommend the <a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/collections/weight-benches" title="Flybird adjustable workout bench">Flybird Adjustable Weight Bench</a> and Dumbbells because they are easy to use and durable.<br><br>This weight bench is perfect for working out at home because it doesn’t take up much space. It also has seven backrest positions and three seat positions so you can focus on your target muscles<br><br>If you're just getting into resistance training, it's important that you have an adjustable weight bench so that you can work different muscle groups in various positions. An adjustable bench makes it easier to perform exercises such as chest flies, triceps dips, or leg lifts on your own. You can also use an adjustable bench as a platform for ab workouts or cardio exercises like step-ups or box jumps.<br><br>If you want to get really serious about strength training at home, then purchasing dumbbells is essential. Dumbbells come in a variety of sizes and weights so that you can add resistance according to your needs. <br><br>The <a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/collections/dumbbells" title="Flybird adjustable dumbbells">Flybird dumbbells</a> are adjustable, so you won’t need to buy different ones as your strength increases.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Incorporate Exercise into Chores</h2>
<p>Most people hate doing housework, but if you treat it as an opportunity to burn calories and get your blood pumping, you may find it less annoying. This is a great way to kill two birds with one stone.<br><br> If you're doing the dishes, do some squats or lunges while you wait for the water to heat up, or do push-ups against the kitchen counter while waiting for something in the microwave.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Lift Weights at Home with Dumbbells</h2>
<p>Do bodyweight exercises. Bodyweight exercises are any exercise where the resistance is provided by your own weight. They're great because they require no additional equipment and can be done almost anywhere. There are dozens of bodyweight exercises you can do, including push-ups, pull-ups, and squats. You can find online tutorials for how to do these exercises properly or even download apps to help you track your progress and create <a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/blogs/workouts/4-popular-exercise-you-can-do-with-flybird-adjustable-dumbbells" title="4 Popular Exercise You Can Do With Flybird Adjustable Dumbbells">workouts</a> for you.<br><br>You can start out small and work your way up as you get <a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/blogs/guide/getting-stronger-with-a-weight-bench-at-home" title="Getting Stronger with a Weight Bench at Home">stronger</a>. You can also find tons of workout routines online that use dumbbells for all parts of the body so that you never get bored with your workout routine.</p>
<p>Do TV time differently instead of just lounging on the couch while watching TV. Do some crunches, stretches, push-ups, or lunges during commercial breaks so you're not just sitting all evening.<br><br>Cleaning out the garage or attic is a great way to work up a sweat, as is raking leaves or mowing the lawn. If you don't have a yard, try walking briskly while vacuuming, or do some jumping jacks while waiting for the laundry to finish drying.<br><br>Run errands by foot if possible instead of taking your car everywhere. Walking is an excellent way to stay fit and healthy!</p>
<h2>Step 4: Make Sure You Get Enough Sleep</h2>
<p>Sleep is more important than exercise for improving your health, according to Dr. Charles Samuels, medical director of the Centre for Sleep and Human Performance in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. "You need sufficient sleep in order to maintain optimal physical performance," he says.<br><br>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), adults need at least seven hours of sleep each night for good health and safety reasons — although some adults may need up to nine hours or more.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Exercise can be a challenge, especially if you don’t have the financial means to join a gym. That said, there are plenty of ways you can get fit even if you don’t have a gym membership. Is it going to be more difficult? Yes, probably. But when something is worth having, we tend to make sacrifices and sometimes go the extra mile to get it.<br><br>These four tips are really just a starting point. As we said, there are many ways you can increase your level of fitness without ever stepping foot inside a gym. And not only will this help you to keep fit and healthy, but it will ensure that you have an active lifestyle in general, which can have a profound effect on your well-being in the long term. Once again, it all comes down to creativity, discipline, and determination. There’s so much more to it than simply showing up to the gym once every couple of days and wandering around aimlessly inside until you’re kicked out by someone who thinks you should pay for the privilege of treadmilling for an hour or two. Keep working at it and don’t give up!</p>

Here are five things to help you avoid these common dumbbell training mistakes.<p><a class="read-more" href="https://flybirdfitness.com/blogs/exercise-tips/5-mistakes-you-re-making-with-your-dumbbell-exercises">More</a></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>If you've ever used dumbbells before, you know they can be great additions to any workout. But like all exercise equipment, if you're not using them correctly, they won't do much for your body. Here are five common mistakes people make with <a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/blogs/exercise-tips/4-popular-exercise-you-can-do-with-workout-benches" title="4 Popular Exercise You Can Do With Workout Benches">dumbbell exercises</a> and how to fix them:</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Mistake 1. You're using the same hand</h2>
<p><br>If you're using one hand to lift a dumbbell, switch it up and lift it with your other hand. That way, you'll be working out both sides of your body.<br><br>In an effort to lift more weight, many people will hold a dumbbell in one hand and use their free hand to help move it up or down. This is a bad idea for two reasons: It encourages a muscle imbalance because you'll be recruiting more muscles on one side of your body than the other, and it could lead to injury.<br><br>The Fix: Use both hands when lifting a dumbbell, even if it means lessening the weight you're using.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Mistake 2. You think more is better</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Don't regard weights as "good" or "bad." Instead, focus on safe weight-lifting techniques.</p>
<p>I see it time and time again: People think that if they pick up heavier weights, they'll be able to build muscle. This is not true for a number of reasons.<br><br>First, you need to be able to get your form down with lighter weights. If you can't do five perfect reps with a lighter weight, then you should not be using a heavier weight. Second, you do not need as much weight as you think. Picking up a heavy dumbbell is not necessary for building muscle. The most important thing is to focus on the muscle that you are targeting, and let it do the work without relying on momentum or other muscles to help out.<br><br>Finally, people tend to use too much weight when they are doing exercises like shoulder presses and bicep curls. If you're trying to build shoulder or bicep strength, there's no shame in doing higher reps with lighter weight at first. You can always increase the weight once your muscles get stronger!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Mistake 3. You don't have the right size</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Use dumbbells that are the right size for you. You don't want them to be too heavy or too light.</p>
<p>If your dumbbells are too heavy, you won't be able to complete a full range of motion, as the weight may prevent you from reaching a particular position. For example, if you're doing biceps curls with a dumbbell that's too heavy, you won't be able to bring the weight to your shoulder at the top of the move because it's just too difficult. In this case, your form will be compromised and your chances of injury will increase.<br><br>If the weights are too light, however, you won't be working as hard as you could be and will not see optimal results.<br><br>If this is a problem for you, try one of two things: either adjust the weight so that it's something more appropriate or simply lower the number of reps in a set until you can complete each one with proper form. If you don't want to buy too many dumbbells, but need to make your workout flexible, <strong><a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/collections/dumbbells" title="Flybird adjustable dumbbells">FLYBIRD adjustable dumbbells</a></strong> are the right option for you. The compact size of this product will enable you to save a lot of extra space in your home gym or any other exercising place.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Mistake 4. You're lifting too much weight too quickly</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Don't try to lift too much weight too quickly. Start out with light weights and work your way up to heavier weights.</p>
<p> When you're starting out with a new exercise, you have to get used to the movement before adding more weight. That's especially true with dumbbells because they require more balancing than barbells. If you try a shoulder press with too much weight too soon, you'll end up cheating and using your upper body momentum to get the job done. This can cause shoulder or back injuries if it becomes a habit, so keep your form straight until you can do at least 10 reps easily with that weight.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Mistake 5. Your wrists aren't in line with your shoulders and elbows</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Elevate your <strong><a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/collections/weight-benches" title="Flybird workout bench">workout bench</a></strong> when you do bicep curls so your wrists are in line with your shoulders and elbows. Otherwise, you'll end up hurting yourself over the long term.</p>
<p>If you're doing a chest fly or biceps curl, your wrists should be in line with your forearms and elbows. If they're turned inward, the weight of the dumbbells can cause you to feel a strain in your wrist and possibly even injure it.<br><br>To fix this common dumbbell mistake, you can use a wrist wrap, which will provide extra support for your wrist joint. You'll want to make sure the wrap is tight enough so that there's no play in your wrist but not so tight that it cuts off circulation. If you find yourself using a lot of heavy weights with this movement, try using thicker wraps or wraps made from a material that's better at absorbing moisture (like terry cloth).</p>
<p>If you want to see a bigger change in your physique without adding noticeably more time to your workouts, it’s important to be knowledgeable and make smart decisions when choosing exercises. That’s why we’re presenting these 5 dumbbell exercises that most <a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/blogs/guide/4-simple-steps-to-create-a-beginners-workout-plan" title="4 Simple Steps to Create a Beginner's Workout Plan">beginners</a> make a mistake with, along with healthy alternatives designed to maximize efficiency and ultimately help you reach your fitness goals.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[Doctors have long relied on the body mass index (BMI) to help determine whether an adult is overweight. But according to a new study published in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings, BMI may not be the best way to measure someone's health.<br><br><br><br>When choosing whether or not to approve a patient for weight loss surgery, doctors often use BMI as a first step. If you fall into the categories of either "overweight" or "obese," your doctor might refer you to a therapist. This can help lead to more lifestyle changes, like exercise and healthier eating habits.<br><br><br><br>But there are problems with using BMI alone as a health measure. The main issue is that it doesn't account for muscle mass, which can skew results for people who work out regularly. One study found that almost 50% of competitive bodybuilders were considered obese when only looking at their BMI scores.<br><br><br>BMI may not be the most accurate tool for everyone, but it's still a useful measure of an individual's overall health, said Dr. Gupta.<br><br>"BMI is not perfect," he said. "It doesn't take into account muscle mass."<br><br>But BMI is still a helpful guideline for determining if someone is obese or at a healthy weight, according to Gupta. The best way for individuals to truly determine if they are at a healthy weight, he added, is to consult with their doctors.<br><br><br>Men and women have different body types, so the formulas are different for each gender. The formulas also change based on a person's age; they tend to overestimate obesity in older people and underestimate it in younger ones.<br><br>Ultimately, most people will benefit from working towards a healthy BMI. But even if you're not technically overweight or obese according to BMI standards, being out of shape can still have effects on your health. So whether you use BMI as a guideline or not, it's always a good idea to keep your health in mind by eating well, exercising regularly, and staying in touch with your doctor.<br><br>]]>

Here are five ways to keep going when motivation fails.</span><p><a class="read-more" href="https://flybirdfitness.com/blogs/exercise-tips/5-ways-to-easily-stay-motivated-to-exercise">More</a></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>When I started exercising, I was excited, motivated, and had lots of energy. After a couple of months, my excitement began to fade away, and my motivation turned into procrastination. I realized that if the same routine was going to be repeated every day, it was going to get really boring really quickly. That’s when I started to take action and make my own changes to stay motivated. After doing some research, I found several helpful tips that have since helped me stay on track with my exercise goals.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>1. Be realistic and adapt your exercise routine to your lifestyle</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>If your life is already crowded, in this case, trying to maintain a good habit of exercise can become hellish. You need to think over and over again, can I really keep doing this for a long time? If the answer is no, then you need to make your life less rushed and crowded first. If the answer is yes, then go for it. Don't try to let undeveloped habits change your original way of life, but let undeveloped habits adapt to your original way of life. For example, instead of making time for running on a treadmill, get a fitness pal such as <strong><span style="color: #ff8000;"><a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/collections/dumbbells" target="_blank" title="Flybird Adjustable Dumbbells" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ff8000;">adjustable dumbbells</a></span></strong> and an adjustable workout bench that will not take too much of your space. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>2. Don't rely on motivation, do it again</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>People often think that it takes motivation to keep exercising. But sometimes the motivation doesn't appear on its own, and there's no motivation to do it? Obviously not. Waiting for motivation to come to you is a waste of time and willpower. Because waiting is a simple excuse to avoid taking action. So one way to stick to a habit is to not rely on motivation. Motivation is fragile, sometimes created on a whim, and sometimes lost silently. Instead of relying on motivation, act now. Action creates everything. Simply taking action doesn't depend on motivation, it just requires you to do something. Just like you don’t need to wait until you’re motivated to go for a walk, just go for a walk! Sometimes negative thoughts pop into your head and keep you from taking action. At this point, you need to tell them to go away, and it's your actions, not your thoughts, that can change reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>3. Remember your workout goals and recall initial thoughts</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>When you lack the motivation to continue your exercise habit, take a step back and think back to your own initial thoughts, why are you trying to get into the exercise habit? Since the answer to this question motivates you to persist in making the change in the first place, then Now is also okay. Close your eyes and imagine yourself healthy and full of energy. Write down your fitness goals every day. These methods will help you stick to it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>4. Find a group of like-minded people</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The power of groups cannot be ignored. With these like-minded people, the atmosphere will go a long way in helping you persevere. Focus on the positive effects of building exercise habits and ignore the negative ones. Getting back into the gym can be fun, but you should make your fitness goals realistic. The Flybird workout bench is a great way to exercise without putting too much strain on your body. If you want to break up workouts and add in some Pilates or Yoga routines, the <strong><span style="color: #ff8000;"><a href="https://flybirdfitness.com/collections/weight-benches" title="Flybird Workout Bench" style="color: #ff8000;">Flybird workout bench</a></span></strong> can support that too.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>5. Take some action to remind yourself to keep exercising</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>It's like "If you want to eat healthier, put fresh fruit on the counter and hide snacks." Seeing healthy foods will encourage you to choose healthy foods over chips or ice cream. Same, "If you want to work out in the morning, lay out your workout clothes the night before, and keep your workout bench by your bed, all of which will motivate you to keep exercising.</p>]]>
